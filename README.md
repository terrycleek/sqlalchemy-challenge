Some reason I had to have pip install sqlalchemy. I thought this was already downloaded from using it in class.
Everything else here seemed pretty straight forward

-part 2 Flask app.py

Kind of struggled with this quite a bit. I dont know if I would have been to complete this without constantly referencing the solutions guide. I tested the output for the different routes and it looks ok... Unsure how to add column identifiers in the JSON output to understand what I am looking at. Or if that should just be included as text on the homepage at what the output represents. Once again unsure if output is 100% perfect. Example when JSON return of precipitation data It is not 356 I think 351. Should there be missing days?
